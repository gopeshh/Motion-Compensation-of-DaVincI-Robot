# Motion-Compensation-of-DaVinci-Robot
 Simulated the DaVinci surgical robot to compensate for the motion of constantly moving organs like heart while performing surgery. Used Kalman filter to predict the motion of the heart and the PSM of the DaVinci robot compensated for this varying motion of the organs in any configuration. Simulation is done using ROS and Gazebo.
